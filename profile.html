         <h3>CHRISTIAN GEORGEOU</h3>
         <h4>PRODUCT MANAGER  | PLATFORM</h4>
          <p>I was suppose to be a foreign service officer with the state department.  I loved solving real-world problems connected to actual people, excelled at bridging communication gaps between parties who think differently, and always relied on facts and hard data to make decisions or recommendations.  I  graduated from the University of Stony Brook with degrees in International Relations and Business Management.  Working for the American Red Cross and living in Hong Kong for 2 years, I thought was leading me to a career in the foreign service; in fact it was preparing me for the versatile world of product management.</p> 

          <p>Today, I work for Infor, leading 3 feature teams focused on technology stack and platform as a service solutions. My time is spent writing product specifications as well as UML diagrams, wire-framing screens, designing and leading onsite usability tests, and work with UX to rapid prototype new features and ideas.</p>

          <p>Prior to Infor I was a Sr. User Acquisition Manager at Maaii, a native iOS and Android mobile app start-up, where I focused on campaign design and analysis as well as product enhancements designed to facilitate efficient acquisition and retention of users. I leveraged data from multiple sources (Facebook API, In-house reporting, Google Anlytics, product reviews, user testing) to create profiles of users and usage and assess opportunities for enhancement. </p>
